\section{Evaluation}

To have an understaing of the data, it needs to be visualized. For this purpose matplotlib is used.
The data from the experiments is loaded from the csv files and matplotlib creates the diagrams and histograms.


\subsection{Assessment of scalability}

In a normal working scenario, for the same endpoint the latency should be consistent. CITE SOMETHING

Throughput should grow linearly with the number of clients until a point where one of the bottleneck resources is saturated. 
After that point, the throughput should remain constant. CITE SOMETHING
